Case study I
d1 = {w1, w2, w3, w4, w6}
d2 = {w1, w2, w3, w6},
d3 = {w1, w2, w4, w6}, 
d4 = {w1, w4, w6}, 
d5 = {w4, w5, w6},
d6 = {w4, w6}

Step 1: Create inverted index of the breached data and create co-occurrence matrix for the breached dataset.
Breached data:

Keyword Co-occurrence matrix:

Step 2: Construct the co-occurrence matric for the query response from the server.
Server response:

Query Co-occurrence matrix:


Step3: Create the mapping knowledge K, which includes the mapping between query tokens and keywords that share a unique frequency of occurrences.

Unique length: {q3: w1}, {q4: w2}, {q2: w3}, {q1: w4}, {q6: w5}, {q5: w6}

Since, all the unique keyword mapping established for query and keyword is recovered. The count attack is possible.
